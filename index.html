      <h2>Role</h2>
      <h3>UX Designer: User Research, Definition and Synthesis, Ideation, Wireframing, Prototyping, and Iterations.</h3>
      
      <h2>Timeline</h2>
      <h3>October 2021</h3>
      
      <h2>Tools</h2>
      <h3>UX Designer: User Research, Definition and Synthesis, Ideation, Wireframing, Prototyping, and Iterations.</h3>
      
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>During my UX UI Bootcamp in a team of three we were asked to create
        a brand-new mobile application. The mobile application needed to include solving a real, clearly identified need in users’ everyday lives. We created an app that offers the opportunity to help people within your community by providing a digital tool to share services without spending money.</h3>
      
      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <h3>Not everyone has the financial resources to pay for services when they need it. How might there be an alternative way to get help without spending money?</h3>
      
      <h2>User Research</h2>
      <h3>I shared a survey and as a team we interviewed 4 individuals over the age of 18 which led us to finding:  

        100% of respondents from the survey were interested in the app. 
        
        Some main points users mentioned during user interviews were:
        
        “I could post on Facebook marketplace but that isn’t a trade!”- Abby O.
        
        “This would be really helpful for people in need or people who don’t have the resources”- Hazheen J.
        
        How could we find a fair way to mediate the trades digitally? 
        "Creating a reward system for people who hold up their end"- Tyler B.</h3>
      
      <h2>Proto Persona</h2>
      <h3>Based off our survey and user interviews as a team we created a proto persona to adequately represent our target users needs and traits.</h3>

      </div>
      
      <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
      <h3>I completed a competitor analysis. I found it difficult to find current apps close to our idea. Fiverr was the closest to our idea but you have to pay for services instead of trading for them. </h3>
      <div class="text-center">

      </div>
      
      <h2>Empathy Map</h2>
      <h3>As a team we created an empathy map based on our findings to accurately empathize with users. Throughout the design process I consistently tried to empathize with Micah and her needs. </h3>
      <div class="text-center">

      </div>
      
      <h2>Value Proposition</h2>
      <h3>Trading Aces helps users feel like their skills are being used to help one another while they are saving money.</h3>
      
      <h2>Story Time</h2>
      <h3>To better understand users we developed a storyboard to tell Micah's story. Telling a story helped us to better understand Micah and her needs.  </h3>
      <div class="text-center">
        <img src="Trading Aces/New Storyboard ta.PNG" class="rounded" alt="StoryBoard">
      </div>
      
      <h2>Paper Prototyping</h2>
      <h3>As a team we all created our own paper sketches and then took parts from all of them and combine them into one design. After we came up with a design we used the marvel app to do user testing on our sketches to find any small issues before we started wireframing. </h3>

      </div>
      
      <h2>Prototyping</h2>
      <h3>Some issues we were we needed to add a profile page, listing page, and confirmation pages when listing(s) were posted. </h3>
      <div class="text-center">

        <img src="Trading Aces/Prototype 2.PNG" class="rounded" alt="Prototype2">
      </div>
      
      <h2>User Testing</h2>
      <h3>We each tested two people making a total of six interviews. These are the main iterations that need to be made: </h3>

      </div>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <h3>Asking the right questions is KEY to finding the best insight.
        User Testing with a larger audience and gathering more quantitative feedback would help the most in ideating for the future of this app.</h3>

      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <h3>Conduct more user testing on the “Tradebucks” aspect to our app. 
        Iterate on iOS prototype based on user feedback.</h3>
